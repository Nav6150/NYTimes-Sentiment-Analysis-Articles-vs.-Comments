But the story actually begins in 1947,

as I learned when getting my PhD in international political economy at Princeton

While postwar planners envisioned a multilateral trade/investment/monetary system after WWII,

the weakness of every industrial economy except the US doomed those efforts to failure

Instead, what developed was a US-centered world political economy w 5 main features

1) The US was, as noted, the only intact industrial power

2) Until 1958, the US dollar was the only currency that was universally accepted,

so it became the global currency for ALMOST ALL international trade & investment

3) The US also had ~50% of world gold reserves

4) Because US-based multinationals dominated global oil trade,

the price of oil was denominated in US dollars

5) Due to its system of military bases throughout the world, 

the US provided security globally outside the Soviet bloc

& became the main engine of international economic growth

The result was the US dollar became the currency for global trade & investment for the rest of the world

This gave the US a privilege no other country had since the Roman Empire:

The ability to construct its fiscal & monetary policies WITHOUT ANY EXTERNAL CONSTRAINTS like trade or balance of payment deficits

Given this, Trump is totally WRONG to claim the US has been ""ripped off""

Rather, the system worked to EVERYONE'S advantage but ESPECIALLY the US",2025-02-14 14:15:19,2025-02-20 01:03:44,2025-02-14 14:15:19,229,5,False,,,1,comment,0,0,139793277,False

A lot of people in the northeast prefer to conduct business this way.

Apparently, in states like Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey, it‚Äôs quite common for businesses to have massive legal retainers. And what they do is, they engage in lengthy contract negotiations neither side has any intention of making good on. Then they sign the contract negotiated completely in bad faith by both parties. Then they sue each other and ask the courts to ‚Äúwin‚Äù over the other side.

Before I actually started doing some business in the northeast I thought this sounded too bizarre to be true. But it *is* true. This is actually how a lot of businessmen from that area conduct business. 

Instead of actually negotiating a contract on good faith terms and simply adhering to those terms and skipping the long expensive legal battles, they prefer to negotiate contracts on bad faith and sue for rewards and compensation after the fact. It‚Äôs blows me away how many companies act this way. Their legal expenses are HUGE! You‚Äôd think it would be cheaper and easier just to‚Ä¶ you know‚Ä¶ adhere to good faith contract terms.

This is because prices are set by market competition and when the competing price goes up, all other sources go up also.

Now steel is a component part to manufacturing and construction. When the companies that use steel have its cost go up, then they, in turn must raise their prices to their customers. When that happens, their customers buy less product or build less due to higher costs. And then these users of steel buy less steel, regardless of its source.

Tariffs can be potent and they can change behavior, although much of that may be the domestic hiring or firing of staff and the decreased purchases made by a populace experiencing an inflationary taxation created in its wake.

A particular problem with a mercurial and self-declared genius who moves in and out of a mood to generate this or that tariff is that the particular aims and the program of organization for some planned results does not appear to be of any usable predictable nature.

Trump may consider his behavior some form of bobbing and weaving as in the boxing case, but the very usefulness of the business for confusing opponents is also a major threat to industry and populace of the Nation that such a leader would hope to benefit.   Anxiety and instability are far from the best program for any economic policy or any governmental result of workable benefit. 

Trump is a loose cannon, a veritable chaos engine and that can never be seen as good for any economy.   Industries need to plan for the future and they cannot do this with a Trump in office.

1.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child has held since 1990 that a child's citizenship derives from the parents'.  Paternity of infants has also been as readily determined as maternity for that long as well.

2.  The parents are supposed to petition the home country for things like elementary ed.  Virtually every country sending its citizens to live in the US illegally is in violation of the UN-C-RoC's provisions on elementary ed, and they all signed it.

3. This is done to protect child welfare.  A child cannot survive for long without his/her parents to meet his/her dependency and developmental support needs.  It makes no sense that a child could viable hold citizenship independent of the parents (or that parents could give citizenship of a country in which they are not citizens to the child).

4. The UN-C-RoC was structured this way to protect child welfare.

Just to clarify, a few refineries in the North East US import a bit of light sweet crude from Canada, mostly from my province, by ship.

However, over 95% of the oil Canada exports to the US is heavy sour crude, and midewest refineries have invested many billions in the equipment needed to refine it.  It's all landlocked, so shipped through pipelines which are also multibillion dollar investments.

Right now Trump has only put a 10% import tariff on oil, and the midwest refineries might just absorb the cost, at least for a while.

I live in Orange Co., California and my daughter lives in San Diego. I drive back and forth several times per year.
In the summer, you can see large groups of people picking strawberries over acres of fields on either side of the 5 Freeway. I can't see their faces but I'd bet my life on the fact that they are almost all Hispanic, mainly Mexican. They are stooped over, picking the berries by hand in sometimes 90 degree heat. There is no shade or places for them to sit. There are metal barrels which I assume are water and one or two Porta Potties. I don't know any other details of their working conditions.
When I see them, I realize that they are the reason my family and I always can have big beautiful juicy fresh strawberries for a reasonable price whenever we want them.

Tariffs are a personal obsession with Trump. And are likely to lead to rampant inflation in the US; and thus a sudden downturn in Trump's popularity. With very little in the way of countervailing benefits, to either the country or to Trump. Sudden failure at the outset. What an astonishingly bad move for Trump; but potentially an explosion of healthy buyer's remorse about Trump throughout the country...to the nation's benefit!
Let's picture an additional scenario: Trump declares a national emergency which absolutely requires our control of the Panama Canal. Diplomacy having proved a non-starter, the Pres orders the military to invade Panama--as it did, within living memory, to arrest Noriega--this time to secure the Canal. Hegseth of course signs off on that order. What do the Joint Chiefs of Staff do? The Congress? We, the populace, the readers of the New York Times, and the watchers/listeners of Fox News?

Maybe after he‚Äôs implemented what amounts to a massive American GST on imports you won‚Äôt pay income tax anymore, you‚Äôll just pay for the tariffs.

Placing higher tariffs on imported goods without wage increases to offset the resulting higher costs of goods will not raise the standard of living in America. It will do the opposite. 

Tariffs also spark retaliatory tariffs. As the cost of U.S. goods to foreign consumers goes up, U.S. overseas sales go down, hurting manufacturing and agribusiness and employment at home. Retaliatory tariffs often encourage domestic companies to set up shop outside our country, in order to hold on to their global sales revenue. 

What, if any, alternatives to tariffs are at our disposal to improve our domestic economy and standard of living? 

We should create income and capital gains tax incentives/disincentives to encourage domestic companies that produce goods overseas to bring manufacturing back to America. 

Likewise, we should create non-tariff tax incentives to encourage foreign companies to manufacture goods in America. 

And, if we become more competitive on quality and innovation, not just price, there would be more incentive to buy American at home and abroad. 

Import quotas and/or bans, not tariffs, might also be worth exploring in order to stop ""near-dumping,"" encourage domestic manufacturing, and punish intellectual property theft. 

These are less risky, potentially far more effective alternatives to tariffs.",2025-02-02 00:38:03,2025-02-02 03:38:11,2025-02-02 00:38:04,11,2,False,,,1,comment,0,0,139434802,False

Voodoo economics nothing, he's in love with President McKinley now. 
""William McKinley was a member of the Republican Party. During the late nineteenth century, Republicans strongly supported tariffs to protect growing industries within the United States from foreign competition. The McKinley Tariff was passed into law in 1890, and it dramatically increased the tax rate on foreign products. While many business owners supported this legislation, American consumers generally opposed it, as prices increased for goods. During the late 1800s and early 1900s, the Republican Party and the Democratic Party continuously battled over tariffs. American opposition to the McKinley Tariff was so high that President Benjamin Harrison, a Republican, may have lost reelection in 1892 partly because of his support for the tax.""

Most of the West and Midwest get their oil from Canada. And not all oil is the same. 

1.	Oil Type Mismatch: U.S. refineries are optimized for processing heavier, sour crude oil, which is often imported, while much of the domestic production is lighter, sweet crude. Retrofitting refineries to handle domestic oil would be costly.

	2.	Geographic Logistics: Domestic oil production is concentrated in areas like Texas and North Dakota, far from major coastal population centers. Importing oil to these regions is often cheaper than transporting domestic oil due to infrastructure limitations.

	3.	Global Trade and Economics: U.S. producers export light crude to international markets where it fetches higher prices, while importing cheaper heavy crude for domestic refining. This trade strategy maximizes economic efficiency.

Shoots himself in the foot by triggering senseless tariffs.

In June 2024, sixteen Nobel Prize-winning economists signed a letter warning that former President Donald Trump's proposed economic policies, particularly his tariff plans, could fuel inflation and harm both the U.S. and global economies.

Recently, the Wall Street Journal's editorial board criticized President Trump's new tariffs on Mexico and Canada, labeling it ""The Dumbest Trade War in History.""

 The article argues that these tariffs are misguided and could lead to higher prices for consumers, supply chain disruptions, and strained relations with key trading partners.

These critiques align with the earlier warnings from Nobel laureates, highlighting concerns that such tariff policies may have adverse economic effects.

Trade treaties are developed for long term economic benefits of all countries included in the treaty. The treaty seeks to favor trade between said countries which lowers prices of goods traded between them for end consumers. 

Illegal immigration and drugs are not part of an economic trade treaty. Those issues require the countries involved to develop a much different strategy to decrease and eradicate unlawful persons and deadly substances crossing borders.  

A sound trade treaty involves expert economists. 

A solid anti immigration and illegal drug deterence  involves exceptional law enforcement and proven anti drug global policies to address the many facets of both these non economic issues. 

To address illegal deadly substances crossing into the US with tariffs is akin to putting out a fire with gasoline vs.water.  

To use economic policy ( tariffs) to deter persons from illegally crossing borders will penalize US citizens( lower/middle economic brackets) by increasing prices of all goods traded. 

Neither makes any sense as both Mexico and Canada will have less monies to tackle illegal crossings and Mexico will have much less to fight against the drug cartels and the vast drug industry destroying their country and killing tens of thousands of young Americans.

Now imagine--just an imaginary situation--a foreign country that receives billions of dollars  from the  U.S. but is required to spend that money on U.S. manufactured bombs (each 2000 lbs), fighter jets, (including fuel) Apache helicopters, etc. That money comes from the U.S. Treasury.  U.S. weapons makers make billions. What do U.S. workers get? A job. (Let's for the moment not even think where those bombs are dropped; anyway, this is all imaginary.)

Neither protests nor the use of force accomplish anything here; reasons fall on deaf ears; facts that contradict one‚Äôs prejudgment simply need not be believed‚Äîin such moments the stupid person even becomes critical‚Äîand when facts are irrefutable they are just pushed aside as inconsequential, as incidental.

Never again will we try to persuade the stupid person with reasons, for it is senseless and dangerous.

""In CBO‚Äôs estimation, the trade barriers put in place
by the United States and its trading partners between
January 2018 and January 2020 would reduce real GDP
over the projection period. The effects of those barriers
on trade flows, prices, and output are projected to peak
during the first half of 2020 and then begin to subside.
Tariffs are expected to reduce the level of real GDP
by roughly 0.5 percent and raise consumer prices by
0.5 percent in 2020. As a result, tariffs are also projected
to reduce average real household income by $1,277 (in
2019 dollars) in 2020. CBO expects the effect of trade
barriers on output and prices to diminish over time
as businesses continue to adjust their supply chains in
response to the changes in the international trading
environment. By 2030, in CBO‚Äôs projections, the tariffs
lower the level of real GDP by 0.1 percent.""

2(a) points to 2(e) describing what is covered (other than energy as described in 2(b)).  2(e) dissembles into a welter of previous regulations.  Tuesday February 4 is too soon to figure this out for all articles in my opinion, so expect a back up at ports of entry as the typical Trump confusion reigns.

de minimis is when a person in, say, Texas buys directly from an entity in Canada (tax 25%) or Mexico (tax 25%) or China (tax 10%) including via mail or direct carriage (say, carry via a plane or car).   However, one has to read the pile of regulations to know if there is a tax on the particular article or object.  Good luck with that when you drive/fly in and declare anything, the customs person probably has very little more idea than you at this time.

No indication of how the import taxes will be collected for mail-- I presume that there is already some kind of plan in place, but with Musk-a-Trump that might be a presumption too far.
